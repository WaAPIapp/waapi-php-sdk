## Introduction

 PHP package to easily interact with [waapi.app](https://waapi.app).


## Installation

### Composer

```shell
composer require waapi/waapi-php-sdk
```

## Usage

### Initial Setup

```php
use WaAPI\WaAPISdk\WaAPISdk;

$apiToken = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
$sdk = new WaAPISdk($apiToken);
```

### Check if WhatsApp API is available

```php
$isAvailable = $sdk->isApiAvailable();
```

### Create a new instance

```php
// Create a basic instance
$instance = $sdk->createInstance();
$instanceId = $instance->id;

// Create an instance with a name and webhook
$instance = $sdk->createInstance(
    name: 'My Instance',
    webhookUrl: 'https://my.url.com/webhook/handler',
    webhookEvents: ['message', 'ready', 'qr']
);
```

### Get an existing instance

```php
$instanceId = 10; //you need to know your instance id at this point
$instance = $sdk->getInstance($instanceId);
```

### Update an existing instance

```php
$instanceId = 10; //you need to know your instance id at this point

//if a subscribed event occurs, this url will be requested with the event data
//can also be null if you do not want to receive webhooks
$webhookUrl = '';
$subscribedEvents = ['', '']; //can also be null or an empty array

$sdk->updateInstance($instanceId, $webhookUrl, $subscribedEvents);

// You can also update the instance name
$sdk->updateInstance($instanceId, name: 'New Name');

//if you have an instance object, you can also use the following method
$instance = $sdk->getInstance($instanceId);
$instance->update($webhookUrl, $subscribedEvents);
```

### Delete an existing instance

```php
$instanceId = 10; //you need to know your instance id at this point
$sdk->deleteInstance($instanceId);

//if you have an instance object, you can also use the following method to delete this instance
$instance = $sdk->getInstance($instanceId);
$instance->delete();
```

### Get the QR-Code

After creating a new instance, you need to connect your WhatsApp phone number with this instance.
With the following code, you are able to receive the current QR-Code.

```php
$instanceId = 10; //you need to know your instance id at this point
$response = $sdk->getInstanceClientQrCode($instanceId);

//if you have an instance object, you can also use the convenience method
$instance = $sdk->getInstance($instanceId);
$response = $instance->clientQrCode();

// The QR code as a base64 image string (data:image/png;base64,…).
// Set this string in the src attribute of a <img src=””> html tag.
$qrCode = $response->qrCode;
```

### Get the instance status

An instance always has a status.

| Status         | Description                                                                                     |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| booting        | The node is starting the instance. The status will change to `loading_screen` soon.             |
| loading_screen | The instance is starting WhatsApp Web. The status will change to `qr` or `ready` soon.          |
| qr             | The instance needs to be connected with a WhatsApp phone number. You can fetch the QR code now. |
| authenticated  | The connection via the QR code was successful. The status will change to `ready` soon.          |
| auth_failure   | The connection via the QR code failed or WhatsApp Web is down.                                  |
| ready          | The instance is ready to use. You are able to execute actions and send messages.                |
| disconnected   | Disconnected from WhatsApp Web                                                                  |

```php
$instanceId = 10; //you need to know your instance id at this point
$response = $sdk->getInstanceClientStatus($instanceId);

//if you have an instance object, you can also use the convenience method
$instance = $sdk->getInstance($instanceId);
$response = $instance->clientStatus();

$instanceStatus = $response->instanceStatus;
```

### Get information about an existing instance

```php
$instanceId = 10; //you need to know your instance id at this point
$response = $sdk->getInstanceClientInfo($instanceId);

//if you have an instance object, you can also use the convenience method
$instance = $sdk->getInstance($instanceId);
$response = $instance->clientInfo();

//your public name of your WhatsApp profile (your name)
$displayName = $response->displayName;

//the connected WhatsApp phone number (your phone number)
$phoneNumber = $response->formattedNumber;

//profile image url of the connected WhatsApp phone number (your profile picture)
$profileUrl = $response->profilePicUrl;

//a unique identifier for your WhatsApp account / profile / phone number
$whatsAppId = $response->contactId;
```

### Execute actions

Once your instance is in `ready` state, you can execute WhatsApp actions:

```php
$instanceId = 10;

// Send a text message
$result = $sdk->executeInstanceAction($instanceId, 'send-message', [
    'chatId' => '491234567890@c.us',
    'message' => 'Hello from waapi!',
]);

// Send media
$result = $sdk->executeInstanceAction($instanceId, 'send-media', [
    'chatId' => '491234567890@c.us',
    'mediaUrl' => 'https://example.com/image.png',
    'mediaCaption' => 'Check this out!',
]);

// Using the instance object
$instance = $sdk->getInstance($instanceId);
$result = $instance->executeClientAction('send-message', [
    'chatId' => '491234567890@c.us',
    'message' => 'Hello!',
]);
```

Common actions: `send-message`, `send-media`, `send-location`, `send-vcard`, `get-chats`, `get-contacts`, `get-contact-by-id`, `is-registered-user`, `get-number-id`, `send-seen`, `logout`, `reboot`.

For a full list of available actions and their parameters, see the [API documentation](https://waapi.readme.io).

### Webhook events

When configuring webhooks, use the `WebhookEvent` class for available event constants:

```php
use WaAPI\WaAPISdk\Resources\WebhookEvent;

$sdk->createInstance(
    name: 'My Instance',
    webhookUrl: 'https://my.url.com/webhook',
    webhookEvents: [
        WebhookEvent::MESSAGE,
        WebhookEvent::READY,
        WebhookEvent::QR,
        WebhookEvent::DISCONNECTED,
    ]
);

// Subscribe to all events
$sdk->createInstance(
    name: 'My Instance',
    webhookUrl: 'https://my.url.com/webhook',
    webhookEvents: WebhookEvent::ALL
);
```
